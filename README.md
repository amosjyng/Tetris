Tetris
======

Pass a "--help" argument while running this from the commandline to see available options. In short,

* pass no arguments to play as a human player
* "--ai" has the AI play on default settings
* "--ai --genetic" has the AI evolve new weights for 10 generations

In addition, shapes in the queue are output to stdout. So if you are playing as a human and you do not run this via the commandline, you will not know what shapes are coming next in the queue.
